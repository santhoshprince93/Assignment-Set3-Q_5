5.	In January 2005, a company that monitors Internet traffic (WebSideStory) reported that its sampling revealed that the Mozilla Firefox browser launched in 2004 had grabbed a 4.6% share of the market.

I.	If the sample were based on 2,000 users, could Microsoft conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the market?

II.	WebSideStory claims that its sample includes all the daily Internet users. If that’s the case, then can Microsoft conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the market?

Ans: As (p_value = 0.2058) > (α = 0.05) ; Accept Null Hypothesis i.e. Mozilla market share > 5% Thus, Microsoft can not conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the market

II. WebSideStory claims that its sample includes all the daily Internet users. If that’s the case, then can Microsoft conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the market?

We are given that WebSideStory claims that its sample includes all the daily Internet users.

This means that the 4.6% is the population percentage. Comparing it with Microsoft's claim that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the whole market is True.

Hence, we can conclude that Mozilla has a less than 5% share of the market.
